1.(10 pts) In the function main on line 33, a mov instruction copies the stack pointer address into r0.

	a.What is that the address of? (Hint: Look at the C code)
This is the address of the space created for the point struct

	b.What is it used for afterwards in init and main?
This is used as the address to put the values for the point struct on the stack


2.(10 pts) Which two lines in the C program (put the full line of code, not
					 line numbers) correspond to the following two lines of function init
					 in the assembly version?
	local.x = x_arg;
	local.y = y_arg;

	str r1, [sp]
	str r2, [sp, #4]


3.(10 pts) In the function zero, what value(s) does the program store at
					 addresses [sp] and [sp, #4] (Lines 19 and 20)?
		0 and 0


4.(10 pts) Which two lines in the C program (put the full line of code, not
					 line numbers) correspond to the following two lines of function zero
					 in the assembly version?
	local.x = 0;
	local.y = 0;

	str r3, [sp]
	str r3, [sp, #4]


5.(10 pts) Based on the ARM code (not the C code), in the function zero, what
					 does it return? Remember, there is no specific return <variable>
					 command in ARM. The return value is always whatever is stored in the
					 register designated to hold the return value (you should know which
					 one this is). Don't answer the question with the register name,
					 actually describe what the value is and what it represents.

The function zero returns the struct with the values 0 put in the stack
addresses given by r0.
